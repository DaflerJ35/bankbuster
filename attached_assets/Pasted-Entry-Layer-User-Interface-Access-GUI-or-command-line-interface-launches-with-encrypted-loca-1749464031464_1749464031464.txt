Entry Layer: User Interface / Access

    GUI or command-line interface launches with encrypted local handshake.

    User authenticates with a local token or biometric method, no external auth call.

    Optional voice command module activated if hardware permits.

Secure Local Runtime

    App starts inside an encrypted sandbox container (e.g., Firejail, AppArmor, Docker Hardened).

    No disk writes unless explicitly saved, using in-memory operations.

    Logs never stored locally unless toggled and encrypted.

Decentralized Connection Initialization

    P2P mesh bootstrap via embedded I2P or Tor node.

    Connects to trusted nodes via randomized path selection.

    Fallback relay server rotates every cycle to prevent pattern recognition.

Module Deployment Menu

    User chooses from Ops Modules like:

        OSINT Sweep

        Internal Recon

        Exploit Delivery

        Post-Exploitation AI

        Red Team Chain Builder

    Each module is self-contained and isolated.

Anonymity + Obfuscation Layer

    Agent mutation happens before any deploy:

        Custom compile with variable encryption, different API call maps.

        Auto-obfuscation of execution paths using randomization trees.

    Every action tunneled via multi-hop proxy chain (SOCKS5 layered over Tor or I2P).

Execution Chain Build

    User builds logical flow or uses natural language (e.g., "Scan, escalate, backdoor legacy node").

    AI parses this into action tree with built-in rollback safeguards.

    Sandbox detection module auto-triggers evasion.

Live Agent Spawn

    Payload injected via stealth mode (SysWhispers, manual syscall chaining).

    Agent stays memory-resident, zero persistence unless forced.

    Post-exploitation agent auto-tags found assets and simulates adversary movement for test scenarios.

Data Exfiltration + Reporting

    Encrypted ZIPs only sent via temporary relay nodes that auto-exp
    ire.

    Option to save reports only locally in military-grade AES container.

Failsafe Mechanisms

    If kill switch is triggered or environment looks hostile:

        App erases runtime memory

        Deletes any temp cache or payload residue

        Disables future execution via biometric + device ID mismatch
